New classes
- MiniMap
	- Stores the values of a minimap
	- prints a minimap on a class SidePanel
	- if a lpayer-s ship moves to a new map, it updates the minimap
	- added two 2D arrays to MiniMap
		- boolean[][] doesMapExist
			- True if there is in fact a room in the provided position
		- int[][] exploredRooms
			-2 if the room at the position is exlpored
			- 1 if the room at the position is a neighbour to any explored rooms
			- 0 if not 2 or 1
	-the minimap will only display rooms if the rooms
		- have been visited by the player
		- are next to a room that is visited by the player
-SidePanel

	- Contains
		- A minimap, displaying the colours of every "room" in the current level

-KeyBindingController
	- Switched out the KeyListener with a class which inherits from KeyBinding
	- Still does not work properly, something with releasing the buttons is off.

Classes Changed
- ObjectStats
	- All the values are now stored in a HashMap instead of having their seperate variables.

Other
- Grid hit detection
	- Introduced a grid system to the GameObjects
	- They now have up to 4 coordinates on a grid
	- I will update the hitDetection code to work with the grid.
