Updates 14.03.18

Made a class ObjectStats which contains most of the information about a GameObject
- Contains variable known to the player, such as Armour, Lives etc

Made a class Bullet which is an object for bullets fired by a ship.
Added obstacles to the maps
- Maps parsed from .txt files under the 'maps' folder

Added hit detection
- Does not work for bullets if the ship is too close to an obstacle

The player's ship cannot go into an invalid map position
- if the player crashes into a wall, the velocity x or y will be multiplied with a constant WALL_REFLECT which makes the ship bounce off the wall.
